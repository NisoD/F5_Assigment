# API Security Improvements

## 1. Enhanced Authentication
- Strong password validation requirements
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control implementation

## 2. Improved Data Security
- Thread-safe data access using `sync.RWMutex`
- Atomic ID generation because the requirment was for ints would use uuid as in common practices
- Password Hashing instead of plain text and hashing comperission
- Comprehensive input validation for all endpoints

## 3. Account Management Enhancements
- Strict access controls for balance operations
- Admin-only account creation
- Critical security checks:
  * Deposit limits enforcement
  * Insufficient funds prevention
  * User existence verification
  * Overflow protection mechanism

## 4. Authentication Middleware
- Comprehensive token validation:
  * Token signature verification
  * Expiration checking
  * Authorization header format validation
- Context-based claims propagation

## 5. Security Best Practices
- JWT secret key management via environment variables
- Prevented sensitive information leakage in error messages
- Advanced input sanitization and validation

## Key Security Improvements
- Replaced plain-text password storage with bcrypt
- Implemented robust role-based access control
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Secured financial transaction endpoints
- Mitigated common web application vulnerabilities
